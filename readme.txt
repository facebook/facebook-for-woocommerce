Get the Official Meta for WooCommerce plugin for powerful ways to help grow your business using Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

== Description ==

This is the official Meta for WooCommerce plugin that connects your WooCommerce website to Meta technologies including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. With this plugin, you can install the Meta pixel, upload your online store catalog, enabling you to easily run dynamic ads and also engage with your customers on WhatsApp.


Marketing on Meta platforms helps your business build lasting relationships with people, find new customers, and increase sales for your online store. With this Meta ad extension, reaching the people who matter most to your business is simple. This extension will track the results of your advertising across devices. It will also help you:

* Maximize your campaign performance. By setting up the Meta pixel and building your audience, you will optimize your ads for people likely to buy your products, and reach people with relevant ads on Facebook and Instagram after they’ve visited your website.
* Find more customers. Connecting your product catalog automatically creates carousel ads that showcase the products you sell and attract more shoppers to your website.
* Generate sales among your website visitors. When you set up the Meta pixel and connect your product catalog, you can use dynamic ads to reach shoppers when they’re on Facebook and Instagram with ads for the products they viewed on your website.
* Engage with customers on WhatsApp. Update your customers about their orders at every step, freeing up more time for you to focus on your business. You can leverage WhatsApp's interactive features to improve customer satisfaction, reduce support cases and build trust.
