### Logging

The plugin offers logging that can help debug various problems. You can enable debug mode in the main plugin settings
panel under the `Enable debug mode` section.
By default plugin omits headers in the requests to make the logs more readable. If debugging with headers is necessary
you can enable the headers in the logs by setting `wc_facebook_request_headers_in_debug_log` option to true.
